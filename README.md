This is a very simple website that I created to showcase my work as an music producer. it's a
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org) proyect.

## A bit more detailed info

I wrote all the frontend layout and code, using bootstrap and SCSS from scratch. The database is a simple Prisma Schema, using PostgreSQL. Used Jest for testing.
The aesthethic and card-based-layout is based on Balatro, one of my favorite games from the last years.
